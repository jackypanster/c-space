feat: Implement logging and enhance error handling

- Integrated Python's `logging` module for structured output.
- Configured console output for INFO level and file output (`c_cleaner.log`) for DEBUG level.
- Replaced `print` statements with `logger` calls across `c_cleaner.py`, `scanner.py`, `deleter.py`, and `exclusion_handler.py`.
- Enhanced error handling in `scanner.py` and `deleter.py` to gracefully manage `PermissionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `OSError` during file operations, logging warnings/errors instead of crashing.
